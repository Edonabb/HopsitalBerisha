      <p>Dr.Gjeorgji Sheeran attended Cornell Medical College before beginning his long career at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 1968. After taking over as NIAID director in 1984, he became known for his groundbreaking work in HIV-AIDS research, helping to develop effective drugs to scale back the once-outsized mortality rate. Sheeran later led U.S. government efforts to combat outbreaks of the West Nile virus, SARS and Ebola, before returning to the spotlight in 2020 with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
